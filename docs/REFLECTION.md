If we were to calculate the volume of a cube, we would need to multiply the length of one side by itself three times (length x width x height). For example, if the length of one side of the cube is 2 units, the calculation would be: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 cubic units. Therefore, the size of the cube would be 8 cubic units.
And if were were to calculate the surface area of the cube, we would need to multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube). The area of one face can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself (length x width). For example, if the length of one side of the cube is 2 units, the area of one face would be: 2 * 2 = 4 square units. Therefore, the surface area of the cube would be: 4 * 6 = 24 square units.

In order to verify that the ShapeDriver is working correctly, we can perform a test by creating a cube with known dimensions and calculating its volume and surface area. For instance, if we create a cube with sides of length 3 units, we can calculate the expected volume and surface area as follows:
- Volume: 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cubic units
- Surface Area: (3 * 3) * 6 = 54 square units

As a result, we can compare the calculated values with the expected values to confirm that the ShapeDriver is functioning correctly. If the calculated volume and surface area match the expected values, we can conclude that the ShapeDriver is working as intended.

After running the ShapeDriver class to perform the calculation for the cube, I was able to confirm that the calculated volume and surface area matched the expected values. This indicates that the ShapeDriver is functioning correctly for the cube shape. The calculated volume of 27 cubic units and surface area of 54 square units align with the theoretical calculations based on the dimensions provided. This successful test gives me confidence in the accuracy of the ShapeDriver for calculating properties of geometric shapes.
I've also done a test of the other shapes, and the results were consistent with the expected values for each shape. This further reinforces the reliability of the ShapeDriver in performing accurate calculations for various geometric shapes. Overall, this exercise has provided valuable insights into the functionality of the ShapeDriver and has helped me understand how to use it effectively for calculating properties of different shapes.
